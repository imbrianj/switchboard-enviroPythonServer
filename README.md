Python is not my normal language so don't expect this code to be particularly good.

Simply modifies [an existing script](https://github.com/pimoroni/enviroplus-python/blob/master/examples/combined.py) and adds a thread to serve the same values to a JSON API.

Meant to be consumed and used by [SwitchBoard](https://github.com/imbrianj/switchBoard) but no reason it couldn't be used for other consumers.

As this is an adapted piece of code, it adheres to the same [MIT License](https://github.com/pimoroni/enviroplus-python/blob/master/LICENSE)
